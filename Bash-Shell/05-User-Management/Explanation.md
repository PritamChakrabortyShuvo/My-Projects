# Explanation:

- This script provides a basic menu-driven interface to manage user accounts.
- **Option 1** : Adds a new user using the **`useradd`** command and provides feedback on success or failure.
- **Option 2** : Deletes a user account using the **`userdel`** command with similar feedback.
- **Option 3** : Changes the password for a user using the **`passwd`** command.
- **Option 4** : Exits the script gracefully.
- The script uses **`sudo`** for administrative commands so the user needs appropriate permissions.
